# TODO

- Fix read process indicator bar on dark mode (suprisingly, works fine on mobile)
- Fix code syntax highlight colors on dark mode
- Figure out a way to rip out highlightjs and replace it with prism.js syntax highlighting
- Maybe add a search bar? Low priority
- Fix back to top button on dark mode
