# TODO

- [x] Fix read process indicator bar on dark mode (suprisingly, works fine on mobile)
- [x] Fix code syntax highlight colors on dark mode
- [ ] Figure out a way to rip out highlightjs and replace it with prism.js syntax highlighting
- [ ] Maybe add a search bar? Low priority
- [ ] Add back comment box (commented out right now) with correct light/dark theme
