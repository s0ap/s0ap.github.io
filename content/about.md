Hey! My name is Vishad. I am an incoming MFE (Financial Engineering) student at the Cornell University. I worked at MSCI from June 2017 &ndash; April 2021 as a senior quantitative index researcher developing smart beta indexes for institutional investors. Before that, I was an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, India where I majored in Economics (MSc.) and Mechanical Engineering (BE.).

Here is where I'll _occasionally_ write on finance, tech and random thoughts. I also plan to write about my courses at Cornell and augment it with relevant research in the field (to hopefully reproduce the results and share the code!).

You can reach me via email at **vishadbhalodia@gmail.com** or **vmb39@cornell.edu**.

PS: If you're interested in the blog design &mdash; I used the Hugo Ivy theme ported by [Yihui](https://github.com/yihui/). The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy). Happy hacking!
